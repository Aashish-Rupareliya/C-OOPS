 1) What is OOP? List OOP concepts

 OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that organizes data and behavior into reusable structures called objects. OOP focuses on creating objects that can interact with each other to solve complex problems. Here are some key OOP concepts:

 1.Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.
 
 2.Object: An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity with its own unique state and behavior. Objects can interact with each other through method invocations.
 
 3.Encapsulation: The principle of bundling data and related behaviors together in a class, hiding the internal details and providing access to the data only through well-defined methods (encapsulated methods).
 
 4.Inheritance: The mechanism by which one class inherits the properties and behaviors of another class. It promotes code reuse and allows the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.
 
 5.Polymorphism: The ability of objects of different classes to respond differently to the same message or method invocation. It allows objects to be treated as instances of their own class or as instances of their parent class.
 
 6.Abstraction: The process of simplifying complex systems by modeling them at a higher level of abstraction. It involves identifying essential features and ignoring unnecessary details.
 
 7.Encapsulation: The process of grouping data and methods within a class, protecting the data from direct access or modification by external code. It ensures data integrity and promotes modular and maintainable code.
 
 2)What is the difference between OOP and POP?
 
 The main difference between Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Procedural Programming (POP) lies in their approach to structuring and organizing code. Here are the key distinctions:

 1.Code Organization:
 OOP: In OOP, code is organized around objects, which are instances of classes. Objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods) together, allowing for modular and reusable code. The emphasis is on creating self-contained objects that interact with each other.
 
 POP: In POP, code is organized around procedures or functions. The program is structured as a series of steps or procedures that manipulate data. Functions may operate on global data, and the emphasis is on the sequence of operations.
 
 2.Data Handling:
 OOP: OOP promotes encapsulation, which means the data and methods that operate on the data are bundled together within objects. Objects hide their internal details and provide well-defined interfaces for interacting with them. Data is accessed through methods, ensuring data integrity and promoting modularity.
 POP: In POP, data is often stored in variables or data structures that can be accessed and modified directly by functions. Functions typically operate on global data, and there is less focus on data hiding or encapsulation.
 
 3.Code Reusability:
 OOP: OOP facilitates code reuse through the concept of inheritance. Classes can inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, allowing for hierarchical relationships and sharing of code. This promotes modularity and extensibility.
 POP: POP lacks inherent mechanisms for code reuse. Functions can be reused by calling them from different parts of the program, but there is no built-in mechanism for sharing code across procedures or functions.
 
 4.Polymorphism:
 OOP: OOP supports polymorphism, which allows objects of different classes to respond differently to the same message or method invocation. Polymorphism enables more flexible and dynamic code, as objects can be treated as instances of their own class or as instances of their parent class.
 POP: POP typically does not provide built-in support for polymorphism. Functions operate on specific data types, and the behavior is determined by the function's implementation.
 
 5.Focus:
 OOP: OOP focuses on modeling real-world entities as objects, emphasizing their interactions and relationships. It promotes a more intuitive and natural way of thinking about software design, with an emphasis on modularity, encapsulation, and reusability.
 POP: POP focuses on the sequence of steps or procedures required to solve a problem. It is more procedural and may involve breaking down a problem into smaller tasks or functions.
